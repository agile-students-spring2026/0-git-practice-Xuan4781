# Code of Conduct in Software Development

Link: [iNaturalist Community Guidelines](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/community+guidelines)

## Why I Find This Interesting

I found iNaturalist's Code of Conduct interesting because it shows that when
contributing to open-source software projects, it’s not just about writing code.
It’s also about building respectful and collaborative communities. I chose this
resource because it is very clear about what not to do when communicating with
your peers.

The document emphasizes what is essential in open-source communities and how
to control your emotions when someone provokes you. When you think about it,
anything can trigger someone on the internet, including interpreting accidental
CAPS as anger.

## Comment on the article

I had not heard of iNaturalist before and it sounds like a very interesting site. I liked how this code of conduct specifies to assume that people mean well and allows space for people to make mistakes if they mean well. I think this is an important mindset that is sometimes overlooked in collaborative environments; majority of people mean well but mistakes can be made. - Bella D'Aquino

Although this article is originally about biological communities, I think it is also very helpful for software development. In software development, we often need to work with other people, and I believe we also need some guidelines to help us communicate politely and effectively. One example mentioned in the article is that sometimes it is better not to use too many technical terms, but instead use simpler and more understandable language. After all, not everyone has the same background knowledge. - Shutong Zhang
