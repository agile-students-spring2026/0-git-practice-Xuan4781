# Code of Conduct in Software Development

## Why I Find This Interesting

I found iNaturalist's Code of Conduct interesting because it shows that when
contributing to open-source software projects, it’s not just about writing code.
It’s also about building respectful and collaborative communities. I chose this
resource because it is very clear about what not to do when communicating with
your peers.

The document emphasizes what is essential in open-source communities and how
to control your emotions when someone provokes you. When you think about it,
anything can trigger someone on the internet, including interpreting accidental
CAPS as anger.
