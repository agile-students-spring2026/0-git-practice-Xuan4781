# Code of Conduct in Software Development

Link: [iNaturalist Community Guidelines](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/community+guidelines)

## Why I Find This Interesting

I found iNaturalist's Code of Conduct interesting because it shows that when
contributing to open-source software projects, it’s not just about writing code.
It’s also about building respectful and collaborative communities. I chose this
resource because it is very clear about what not to do when communicating with
your peers.

The document emphasizes what is essential in open-source communities and how
to control your emotions when someone provokes you. When you think about it,
anything can trigger someone on the internet, including interpreting accidental
CAPS as anger.

## Comment on the article

I had not heard of iNaturalist before and it sounds like a very interesting site. I liked how this code of conduct specifies to assume that people mean well and allows space for people to make mistakes if they mean well. I think this is an important mindset that is sometimes overlooked in collaborative environments; majority of people mean well but mistakes can be made. - Bella D'Aquino
